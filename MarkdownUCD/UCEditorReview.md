# Title:
#### Editor Reviewing the Photographs

# Description:
>This use case, shows how the editor reviews the images post processing. The editor will be allowed to view the ranked images after processing. The web interface will display the images after the algorithm ranks them and sends them through. The Editor will see a list of images that will be ranked on a scale according to picture quality such as brightness, focus, and emotion of image.
The images will be stored in groups ranking from 1 â€“ 5, 1 being the best quality and 5 being the worst. From this the editor will be allowed to view the images in each package as well as see what percentage of images from the dataset are in what group. The editor will also be able to make a choice as to which images to keep and which images will be removed. The editor will also have the option to move the images to a database for long term storage.
