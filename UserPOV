User Point of View Paragraphs

  ( Photographer/Editor ) On the first page of our application, the user will be prompted 
  with a login page where they will either enter existing credentials or sign up. Once the 
  user is signed into the application they will be directed to the home page where they will
  be able to see more about us (the developers) and be given the choice to process the images. 
  They will see the button that says "Get Started!", which will forward the user to our upload 
  page. 
    The upload page will prompt the user to choose the file they want to upload for review.
  The application will then run through and grade the images, and display them for the user
  to see, the image along with the newly aquired rank. The user can now review the images to see if 
  the ratings are satisfactory, the user will then have the option of deleting the images that
  fall below a set rank they choose. If the user decides to delete the images they will be removed 
  from the view and only the images higher than the value they choose as the highest possible to 
  keep will remain. From here the user can view there refined images and then push them to a file. 
  The user will then download the file and sign out of the application.
