  ( Photographer ) On first page of our application the user will be promted with 
  a login page where they will either enter existing credientials or sign up. Once 
  the user is signed into the application they will be directed to the home page 
  where they will be able to see more about us (the developers) and be given the 
  choice to process the images. They will see the button that says "Get Started!", 
  which will forward the user to our upload page. 
  
  The upload page will prompt the user to choose the file they want to upload for review. 
  The application will then run through and grade the images, putting the satisfactory images 
  into a differnt folder from the other photos. The user can now review the images or sign out 
  of the application.
