## Image Classifier
+ We chose to use the NIMA Image Assessment, [Link to GitHub page](https://github.com/idealo/image-quality-assessment),
due to it seeming like the most complete and had the most clear instructions. The ratings are well documented and there 
is a lot of support behind the project. We have decided to stick with the default classifiers due to the wide array of photos
 that could be uploaded. It is difficult for us to predict which types of photos could be uploaded so we decided 
 that leaving the default would be best. An advantage of this is that the classifiers will be broad and general allowing for 
 fair grading on a wide range of images. A disadvantage is our classifier does not specialize in one area.
