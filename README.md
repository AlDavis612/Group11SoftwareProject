## How to use the Application
- The first page the user will see is the login page from where the user just needs to click the sign in button as we do not have the login function connected yet.
- After you press the sign in button you will be taken to the home page where you can click get started which will redirect you to the image processing page.
- Once in the image processing page, you will be given the option to upload single or multiple images to the processing algorithm. You can also select a minimum rank you would like to be displayed. Once you choose the images click process. 
- After Process is clicked the page may take a minute or so depending on file size. Once done the images will be shown below and you can see there related technical and aesthetic ratings.
